## Creating a regular release

1. Create a [new release](https://github.com/lightbend/genjavadoc/releases/new) with:
  * the next tag version (e.g. `v0.11`)
  * title and release description including notable changes
  * link to the [milestone](https://github.com/lightbend/genjavadoc/milestones) showing an overview of closed issues for this release
2. Checkout the newly created tag and publish the release by running `sbt +publishSigned`. You will have to have Sonatype OSS repository rights to publish under `com.typesafe` organisation.
3. Login to [Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/) to close and release the repository.

## Back-releasing for a new Scala version

It is often the case when this compiler plugin needs to be released for a newly released Scala version. For this the process is the following:

1. Checkout the version that is to be back-released, which would be
  * master, if no features or bug fixes were merged to master since the latest release
  * tag, if the master has unreleased features or bug fixes. In this case you will need to cherry pick the commit that adds support for the new Scala version.
2. Create a file `version.sbt` containing `version in ThisBuild := "0.11"` which sets the version to be back-released. This will override the automatic version derivation from the git history. Alternatively you can `set version in ThisBuild := ...` in the command line.
3. Change the Scala version to the release you want to perform, this is done by `++2.12.10` in the sbt command line.
4. Publish the release by running `sbt publishSigned`. You will need Sonatype OSS repository rights to publish under `com.typesafe` organisation.
5. Login to [Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/) to close and release the repository.
